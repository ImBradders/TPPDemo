I am yeldraB Davis, and I will be teaching you during this module. I am an expert in the design and implementation of cross-reality experiences. My research interests lie in leveraging the infinite 3D space that XR equipment provides to improve the usability of such devices. I can be contacted by Teams/Email during working hours. You can also come and see me during my office hours.
